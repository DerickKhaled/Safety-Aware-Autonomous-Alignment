# Safety-Aware Autonomous Alignment: Integrating Multi-Dimensional Safety Optimization into LLM Pretraining Without Human Supervision
Risk-Bounded Training of Language Models with Synthetic Feedback
This paper proposes a novel alignment framework that integrates safety-aware constraints directly into the training loop of LLMs, using synthetic feedback rather than costly human annotations. By embedding a risk-sensitive objective into the model‚Äôs reward structure, this approach aims to train helpful and harmless LLMs without relying on traditional human preference data or reinforcement learning.

# Problem
- Current LLM alignment strategies like RLHF and Constitutional AI rely heavily on:
- Costly and limited human preference data
- Post-training alignment steps that are disconnected from the pretraining objective.
- Insufficient mechanisms for bounding risk and ensuring safety in outputs.

# Solution
This work introduces a risk-bounded training framework using:
- Synthetic risk scores from auxiliary models.
- A reward modeling setup that includes safety thresholds and conservative penalties.
- A training process that guides LLMs away from unsafe regions in the action space via risk-aware gradient updates.
- This approach allows for proactive alignment during training, offering a path toward safer LLMs with zero human feedback.

# Key Contributions
- Risk-aware reward shaping: Encodes soft constraints into reward functions using safety classifiers and scoring models.
- No human feedback required: Fully automated training pipeline relying on synthetic signals.
- Efficient safety enforcement: Uses constrained optimization and conservative penalties to reduce risk in generations.
- Strong safety-performance tradeoff: Maintains model performance while improving harmlessness.

# Results
- Improves harmlessness by up to 28% over RLHF and Constitutional AI on benchmarks such as TruthfulQA and HarmlessEval.
- Shows consistent reductions in risk scores across adversarial prompts.
- Matches or exceeds helpfulness and informativeness compared to models trained with human preferences.
